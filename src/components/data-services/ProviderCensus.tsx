 * G-1 in the delivery tracker is the top programme risk and it says the quiet part: every service
 * here has a provider list that reads "us", and a data service with one provider is a contract
 * address rather than a market. The tracker kept those counts by hand, and by 30 August the
 * hand-written table said Seahorn had none while its registry held two registrations.
 *
 * The number that matters is not how many registered. It is how many answer.
