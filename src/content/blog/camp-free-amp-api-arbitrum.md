excerpt: "camp is a free, tip-fresh REST API for decoded Arbitrum One data (ERC-20 transfers, gas analytics, whale feeds, raw SQL) backed by a self-hosted Amp node running on a ThinkPad. Here's what it is, how it works, and what comes next."
---

Getting useful data out of Arbitrum One takes more effort than it should. Raw RPC gives you encoded logs and hex everything. Dune gives you clean SQL but you're querying a shared cache that can be hours behind. The Graph gives you subgraphs, but writing a subgraph to answer a one-off question is like hiring a contractor to change a lightbulb.

**camp** takes a different path. It's a free, tip-fresh REST API for decoded Arbitrum One data (ERC-20 transfers, protocol events, gas analytics, block-level data) built on top of a self-hosted [Amp](https://amp.thegraph.com) node running on a ThinkPad in a home lab.

No signup. No API key. No dashboard. Just HTTP.

## What is Amp?

Before camp makes sense, Amp needs a quick introduction. (There's a [longer writeup here](/blog/intro-to-amp) if you want the full picture.)

**Amp** is a blockchain-native database built by Edge & Node, the core development team behind The Graph Protocol. It runs a daemon called `ampd` that ingests raw blockchain data (blocks, transactions, logs, events) and stores it in a columnar format (Apache Arrow / Parquet) on local disk. Once the data is there, you query it with SQL.

The key thing Amp does that a regular database doesn't: it decodes smart contract events automatically. Give it an ABI, and it turns raw encoded log data into typed SQL tables. An ERC-20 Transfer event becomes a row in a `transfer` table with `from`, `to`, `value`, and `token` columns, not `0x000000000000000000000000...` blobs you have to decode yourself.

`ampd` exposes a **JSON Lines over HTTP** interface on port 1603. Send it a SQL query, get back newline-delimited JSON. That's the foundation everything else sits on.

Amp is licensed BUSL-1.1. The node software, the query engine, the storage layer: Edge & Node built all of it. camp is one deployment of that infrastructure, run independently.

## What is camp?

camp is a public-facing REST gateway that wraps an Amp node and translates clean HTTP requests into SQL against Amp's internal tables.

Live at **[engine.camp](https://engine.camp)**.

The pitch: same query shape Dune offers (decoded protocol tables, SQL semantics), but updated at chain tip, free, and with a predictable REST interface instead of a query editor.

### Endpoints

| Method | Path | What you get |
|---|---|---|
| GET | `/v1/status` | Latest indexed block + total indexed count |
| GET | `/v1/signatures` | Reference table of well-known event topic0s |
| GET | `/v1/transfers` | Decoded ERC-20 / ERC-721 Transfer events |
| GET | `/v1/events` | Generic decoded log filter by address + topic |
| GET | `/v1/block/{n}` | Full block: header, every tx, every log |
| GET | `/v1/tx/{hash}` | Transaction + its logs |
| GET | `/v1/address/{a}/tx` | All transactions from or to an address |
| GET | `/v1/address/{a}/transfers` | Token movements in and out of an address |
| GET | `/v1/gas/blocks` | Time-bucketed gas / base-fee / throughput stats |
| GET | `/v1/contract/{a}/activity` | Time-bucketed log count for a contract |

Query parameters follow a consistent pattern: `from_block`, `to_block`, `limit`, `bucket` (minute/hour/day), `direction` (in/out/all). Block span is capped at 100,000 blocks. Rows are capped at 1,000. Query timeout is 8 seconds. Rate limit: 30 requests/minute, 500/hour per IP.

### A real example

```bash
# ERC-20 transfers for USDC on Arbitrum One, last 1000 blocks
curl "https://engine.camp/v1/transfers?token=0xaf88d065e77c8cC2239327C5EDb3A432268e5831&from_block=300000000&limit=20"
```

Response is JSON: decoded, typed, human-readable. No hex decoding, no ABI parsing in your client.

```json
[
  {
    "block_number": 300012345,
    "tx_hash": "0xabc...",
    "token": "0xaf88d065e77c8cC2239327C5EDb3A432268e5831",
    "from": "0x1234...",
    "to": "0x5678...",
    "value": "1000000"
  }
]
```

## How it's built

The full stack, from bottom to top:

```
ampd :1603                      Amp node — Parquet on local SSD (ThinkPad)
  ↑ JSON Lines / SQL
nginx :1604                     Shared-secret gate + Redis rate limiting
  ↑ HTTP
Cloudflare Quick Tunnel          Private origin link (URL auto-rotates)
  ↑ HTTPS
camp (Next.js on Vercel)        REST API — translates HTTP → SQL → JSON
  ↑ HTTP
client                          You
```

The Amp node indexes Arbitrum One directly (blocks, logs, decoded events, the lot) storing everything in Parquet on local SSD. The node runs continuously, staying at chain tip.

nginx sits in front of `ampd`, checking a shared secret header and enforcing Redis-backed rate limits. The Cloudflare tunnel gives `ampd` a public HTTPS endpoint without port-forwarding or exposing the home IP. When the tunnel URL rotates, the ops automation updates the Vercel environment variable and redeploys.

The Next.js app on Vercel is thin: parse query params, build a SQL query, POST it to `ampd` via the tunnel, stream the JSON Lines response back as a JSON array. Edge cache handles the rest: 1 hour for finalized block ranges, 5 seconds near tip.

The ThinkPad handles everything from the Amp layer down. Vercel handles the public HTTPS API layer. Total infrastructure cost at rest: electricity.

## Why bother?

Three reasons.

**Freshness.** Dune's public datasets can be minutes to hours behind chain tip. camp is 5 seconds behind at worst (edge cache at tip). For anything involving recent transactions or live monitoring, that matters.

**No account required.** Dune's SQL interface needs an account. Flipside needs an account. camp is just a URL.

**It's a real Amp node.** Not a wrapper around someone else's API. The data comes straight from `ampd` indexing Arbitrum One directly. What you get is what the node has: no middlemen, no re-encoding.

It's not trying to replace Dune. Dune has community queries, visualisations, a dashboard builder, multi-chain coverage, years of historical data going back further than any single node. camp is for the cases where you need fresh data, you want a simple HTTP endpoint, and you don't want to sign up for anything.

---

## Roadmap

camp is actively developed. A few things in progress:

**Decoded protocol data (Phase A)**: Amp's `evm_decode_log` and `evm_topic` UDFs enable typed responses for specific protocol events. The goal is endpoints for Uniswap V3 (pool liquidity, swaps, fees), GMX, and other major Arbitrum protocols: decoded, strongly typed, not just raw logs.

**Explore UI (Phase B)**: Server-rendered dashboard pages that demonstrate what the data looks like: live gas charts, whale activity feeds, slashing history. The data is already there; it just needs a frontend.

**Raw SQL (Phase C)**: `POST /v1/sql` for arbitrary SELECT queries against the Amp tables. Already implemented in camp-data-service (see below). Rate-limited and read-only.

---

## camp-data-service: The Paid Horizon Version

camp is free, which is great for exploration but unsustainable at scale. Running `ampd` takes real hardware. The ThinkPad indexing Arbitrum One is doing real work.

**camp-data-service** is an experimental extension that turns the same Amp node into a paid provider on The Graph Protocol's [Horizon](https://thegraph.com/docs/en/horizon/) payment network.

The idea: instead of free requests, consumers deposit GRT into `PaymentsEscrow` and each request carries a signed TAP (GraphTally) receipt. The camp-data-service gateway validates the receipt, proxies the request upstream to the camp REST API, and the provider earns GRT. Settlement happens on-chain via `CampDataService.collect()`, aggregating receipts into RAVs every 60 seconds and collecting on-chain every hour.

```
Consumer (signed TAP receipt)
  ↓
camp-gateway (Rust/Axum)        receipt validation, proxy, RAV aggregation
  ↓
camp REST API (Next.js)         translates HTTP → SQL
  ↓
nginx + ampd (ThinkPad)         Amp node on Arbitrum One
```

Payment settlement:

```
receipts (per request)
  → aggregator (60s) → RAV
  → collector (1h)   → CampDataService.collect()
                     → GraphTallyCollector
                     → PaymentsEscrow → GRT to provider
```

The pricing is tiered by query cost:

| Tier | Endpoints | CU cost | Per-request fee |
|---|---|---|---|
| BASIC | `/v1/status`, `/v1/block/{n}`, `/v1/tx/{hash}`, `/v1/signatures` | 1 CU | 0.000004 GRT |
| STANDARD | `/v1/transfers`, `/v1/events`, `/v1/address/*` | 5 CU | 0.00002 GRT |
| AGGREGATE | `/v1/gas/*`, contract activity, volume | 10 CU | 0.00004 GRT |
| SQL | `POST /v1/sql` | 20 CU | 0.00008 GRT |

The contract is written in Solidity, inherits from The Graph's `DataService` base contract, and is fully tested with Foundry (27 tests covering the complete provider lifecycle). The gateway is Rust/Axum. Everything is on Arbitrum Sepolia for now: testnet only, not mainnet.

> camp-data-service is experimental and community-built. It is not affiliated with The Graph Foundation or Edge & Node.

## What this demonstrates

camp is a concrete answer to "what does a self-hosted Amp node actually look like in the wild?" It's not a proof of concept; it's a running service indexing a live chain, serving real requests, with a public endpoint.

camp-data-service extends that into "what does it look like when that Amp node becomes a Horizon provider?" The ThinkPad that was quietly serving free queries can, with the Horizon payment layer on top, become a GRT-earning data provider, on the same economic model that Graph indexers use for subgraphs, applied to a home Amp node.

Both projects are open source. The pattern is replicable: run `ampd` against any supported chain, drop the camp gateway in front of it, add camp-data-service if you want Horizon payments. One ThinkPad, one Amp node, one deployment, and you're a provider.
