A while ago we wrote [a long guide on building a Horizon data service by hand](/blog/how-to-build-a-horizon-data-service): the Solidity contract that inherits `DataService`, the Rust gateway that validates TAP receipts and collects fees, the deploy script, the Docker, the config. It's a genuinely useful walkthrough. It's also about two thousand lines of boilerplate you will copy-paste, subtly break, and rediscover the fix for, every single time.

We know, because we did it ten times. Dispatch (JSON-RPC). A files service. A WebSocket relay. A Solana indexer. An MCP gateway. A camp monetiser. Each one was 90% the same payment plumbing wrapped around 10% of an actual idea. At some point copying your own homework stops being a workflow and starts being a smell.

So we did the obvious thing: extracted the 90% into a reusable library ([`horizon-core`](https://github.com/nuthatch-org/horizon-core)), and then built a generator for the rest. It's called **[lodestone](https://github.com/nuthatch-org/lodestone)**, a Claude Code plugin that turns a short spec into a complete, *building*, payment-gated Horizon data service. This post is how to use it, and the story of the gleefully silly service we built to prove it works.

## What a Horizon data service actually is

Two layers, every time:

1. **An on-chain contract** that inherits `DataService` (plus the upgradeable/pausable mix-ins), reuses the shared `GraphTallyCollector` unchanged, and exposes the provider lifecycle: `register → startService → collect → stopService`.
2. **An off-chain gateway** that checks a signed TAP receipt on every request, serves or proxies the data, periodically rolls receipts into a signed RAV, and redeems it on-chain via `collect()`.

The contract differs only in its tier enum and economics. The gateway, thanks to `horizon-core`, is now literally an eleven-line `main.rs`. Everything genuinely novel about your service lives in one place, the **data plane**: the thing that actually produces or serves the data. Lodestone generates everything *except* that, because that part is the point and it's yours.

## Two archetypes

Lodestone asks which shape you're building:

- **`proxy`**: you front an existing upstream over HTTP (an RPC node, a REST API, a file server, a graph-node). The gateway is `horizon_core::run()` verbatim; you write no Rust at all.
- **`pipeline`**: *your service is the indexer*: a `Substrate` streams chain events, pure `Handler`s transform them into a `ChangeSet`, and a `Sink` writes them to Postgres. A `horizon-core` gateway sits in front of the query layer to take payment.

## The whole journey, six steps

```
1. Generate    invoke the skill, answer ~6 questions → a complete repo
2. Build       ./setup-contracts.sh; forge test; cargo build   (lodestone runs these for you)
3. Deploy      forge script ... --broadcast      → note the proxy address
4. Configure   fill gateway.toml + .env          (addresses, keys, upstream)
5. Run         docker compose up                 → Postgres + gateway
6. Provide     stake a GRT provision, register on-chain
```

In Claude Code you just say *"make a new Horizon data service for X"* (or run `/create-data-service`). Lodestone interviews you (name, archetype, tiers, economics, optional per-endpoint pricing) writes the answers, runs its generator, vendors the contract libraries, and **verifies the result compiles and its tests pass before handing it back.** A scaffold that doesn't build is worse than none, so it won't give you one.

## Proving it: Hermit DS, the inverse analytics service

A generator you only ever run on tidy, sensible specs is a generator you don't trust. So we handed lodestone something deliberately strange.

**Hermit DS** is the inverse of every analytics service on the network. Everyone indexes activity. Hermit indexes *absence*: wallets that have gone quiet. Sophisticated dormancy detection: whales who haven't moved in eighteen months, DAOs where quorum has been unreachable for N proposals, LPs who've missed K rebalance cycles. It serves **wake alerts** when a dormant wallet finally stirs. The consumers write themselves: MEV bots hunting stale approvals, security teams watching for compromised custody waking up, on-chain historians, grave-robbers.

It works as a product because absence-of-activity is legitimately valuable signal that nobody indexes, because it's an inverted query shape, awkward for activity-first pipelines. It's funky because the entire pitch is "we watch people who aren't doing anything and tell you the moment they start."

It is also, structurally, just a Horizon data service. So we gave lodestone one paragraph of that spec, picked the `pipeline` archetype (an indexer of absence is still an indexer), three tiers (`DORMANCY`, `WAKE_ALERTS`, `COHORTS`) and turned on per-endpoint pricing. Then we got out of the way.

What came back, with **zero hand-written application code**:

- `HermitDataService.sol` + interface, a deploy script, and a Foundry test suite, with **7/7 tests passing**, exercising the full provider lifecycle against a mock Horizon stack.
- A `Substrate → Handler → Sink` indexer that **runs** (`cargo run -p hermit-indexer`).
- A `horizon-core` payment gateway with compute-unit pricing.
- Docker, config, the contract-dependency setup script, and a README with the deploy runbook.

We didn't take its word for it. We stood the gateway up locally against Postgres and poked it:

- `/health` → `200`. `/ready` (which only passes if the database is reachable) → `200`.
- A request with no `TAP-Receipt` header → `402 Payment Required`. The payment gate is live.
- A request with a malformed receipt → `402 invalid receipt`. Validation is live.

That's the entire generated stack (contract, indexer, and a serving, payment-gating gateway) from a paragraph, building and running locally. The dormancy logic itself? That's the data plane: you replace the generated mock `Substrate`/`Handler`/`Sink` with your real detection, and fill in the three tiers. Lodestone did the boring, error-prone 90%. [The repo is here](https://github.com/nuthatch-org/hermit-ds), and its README says, plainly, that lodestone built all of it.

## The loop that makes it better

Here's the part we're quietly proud of. To trust the generator, we pointed it back at our own fleet: we ported three of those original hand-built services (camp, seahorn, wsaas) onto `horizon-core` so they'd match what lodestone emits. That deleted roughly **four thousand lines** of drifted copy-paste, and more importantly every place a real service *resisted* the port told us exactly what `horizon-core` was missing.

WebSocket relay didn't fit the HTTP proxy. Several services wanted per-endpoint pricing the core couldn't express. So `horizon-core` grew four new capabilities (a pricing policy, a composable router, a pre-forward gate, and a multi-backend resolver) each of which is now both a library feature *and* a lodestone option. Generate a service, find a gap, fix the core, regenerate. The tool sharpens itself on the work.

We left Dispatch alone, by the way. It's a genuinely bespoke JSON-RPC engine (multi-chain routing, consumer credit, escrow pre-checks, response attestation) and forcing it through a generic generator would have been a lossy lie. Knowing what *not* to generate is part of the job.

## Operating what you generate

A service you can't run is a demo. Lodestone ships a companion MCP server, `horizon-ds-mcp`, that lets an agent *operate* a deployed service in plain language: read a contract's economics, check a provider's registration and active tiers, look up a consumer's escrow balance, verify on-chain settlement, probe a gateway's health, and, strictly opt-in behind an operator key, run the provider lifecycle on-chain. Read-only by default, because handing a language model fund-moving transactions unprompted is how you end up in the cautionary-tale section of someone else's blog.

## Try it

```
/plugin marketplace add nuthatch-org/lodestone
/plugin install lodestone
```

Then describe the service you want. If you've got data worth selling and an afternoon, you can be a paid provider on The Graph by the end of it, spending your time on the idea instead of the plumbing.

Start on Arbitrum Sepolia. Build something funkier than Hermit. We'd genuinely like to see it.
