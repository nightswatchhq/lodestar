/**
 * Chain liveness — is this chain still producing blocks at all?
 *
 * Every staleness signal in the stack measures distance to chain head:
 * `blocksBehind`, `syncProgress`, graph-node's `synced` flag, and our own
 * reconcileToNetworkHead. All of them are relative. When a chain STOPS, the
 * head freezes, the distance to it goes to zero, and every one of those signals
 * reports perfect health — correctly, and to entirely the wrong conclusion.
 *
 * A subgraph on a halted chain is at chain head, has no indexing errors, is
 * attested by its indexers and renders green in every dashboard including this
 * one. It will serve the same answer forever. Moonbeam stopped producing blocks
 * around 2026-08-10 and every subgraph on it entered exactly that state; two
 * Celo subgraphs sat behind an indexer reporting itself 99.98% synced against a
 * head that had not moved in 85 hours.
 *
 * The only signal that survives is absolute rather than relative: has the head
 * we observe actually changed over wall-clock time. That is what this module
 * tracks. It is deliberately pure — the cron owns the IO and the cache.
 *
 * See nuthatch-org/graph-support#15.

 * Known weakness, deliberately accepted for now: `head` is the maximum across
 * indexers, so a single node reporting a bogus future height would pin the head
 * above reality and the chain would then read as stalled until the real head
