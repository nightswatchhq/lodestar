// The Direct Indexer Payments agreement lifecycle, assembled from the dips-nest event tables.
//
// Every table read here is EMPTY on Arbitrum One today, and that is the reason to write this now
// rather than on the day it fills. The alternative is composing a view in a hurry, against real
// money, with everybody watching.
//
// ## Why separate `SELECT *` queries rather than one clever UNION
//
// The nest's own `dips_timeline` view unions its sources, and that is the right shape for a view
// living beside the data. This code cannot be exercised against a populated nest, so it is written
// to fail loudly rather than subtly: a `SELECT *` per table has no cross-branch type unification to
// get wrong, and a mistaken column name surfaces in TypeScript as `undefined` rather than as a
// query that returns plausible rubbish. The queries are tiny and the route is cached.
//
// They also run in one `Promise.all`, which costs exactly one `/ready` probe thanks to the
// in-flight coalescing in `nuthatch.ts`.
//
// ## Table names are from the nest's schema, not from guesswork
//
// `schema.json` in nuthatch-org/dips-nest is the source. Worth stating because the convention has
// a trap in it: `RCACollected` becomes `recurring_collector__r_c_a_collected`, not
// `..._rca_collected`, and a reasonable guess is wrong.
