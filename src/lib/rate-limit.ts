// Rate limiting runs in the Edge runtime where ioredis (TCP) is unavailable.

// We use a process-local sliding-window counter. NOTE: this is PER-INSTANCE —
// Vercel may run many edge instances, so the effective global limit is roughly
// (configured limit × instance count). That's an accepted trade-off: it still
// throttles a single IP hammering one warm instance (the common abuse shape)
// with zero external dependencies, and is strictly better than the previous
// always-allow stub. A globally-coordinated limit would need an HTTP-based
// store (e.g. Upstash REST / Vercel KV); revisit if cross-instance accuracy
// becomes necessary.
