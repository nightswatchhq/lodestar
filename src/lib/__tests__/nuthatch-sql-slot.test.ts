/**
 * The `/sql` concurrency gate.
 *
 * A nest caps concurrent queries and refuses the rest with `503 server busy: too many concurrent
 * SQL queries`. This was not theoretical: `/api/dips/agreements` fired nine reads in one
 * `Promise.all` and had consequently never worked against a nest with rows, and `/api/dips` still
 * fires four.
 *
 * What these tests pin is the gate, not a particular number. `SQL_SLOTS` is a measured property of
 * the nest we are pointed at - two when this gate was written against the dips nests, two again now
 * against an allocations nest admitting four - so asserting a literal `1` here would mean the number
 * could only ever be changed by editing tests that appear to be about something else. They assert
 * instead that the peak in flight never exceeds `SQL_SLOTS`, and that under enough callers it
 * actually reaches it: a gate stuck at one passes the first assertion and fails the second.
 *
 * The gate lives in `nuthatch.ts` rather than at the call sites, so what these tests pin is that
 * no composition a caller can write gets past it — and, just as importantly, the three ways a gate
 * like this goes wrong:
 *
 *  - a leaked slot. If a thrown request does not release, the nest is unreachable from this
 *    process for ever after, and the symptom is a hang rather than an error.
 *  - retrying the wrong 503. An unready nest answers 503 too, and sitting in a backoff loop over
 *    that is #1080 again with extra latency.
 *
 * A third failure, the handover race, is **not** covered here and that is deliberate rather than an
 * oversight. Releasing the slot and letting the woken waiter re-check leaves a microtask window in
 * which a continuation queued earlier takes the slot and the waiter then takes it too. The window
 * is real — mutating the release to that form and running this whole file passes — but reaching it
 * needs a caller arriving from a microtask chain of exactly the right depth, and a test tuned to
 * that depth stops testing anything the first time the call path gains or loses an `await`, without
 * saying so. The implementation avoids the window by construction instead: see `withSqlSlot`.
