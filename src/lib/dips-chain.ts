// Reading the DIPS issuance split straight from the IssuanceAllocator, as a second opinion on the
// nest that normally answers for it.
//
// `/api/dips` is event-derived and has no fallback, deliberately: nothing else indexes these
// contracts, and a fallback would only be a way of inventing numbers. The cost of that decision is
// that the surface has no second opinion at all. `/ready` catches a nest that has stopped. Nothing
// catches a nest that is running happily and merely missed a log, and that failure renders as a
// plausible number rather than as an error.
//
// The allocator will answer the same questions directly, and the answer comes with an exact
// invariant rather than a fuzzy one: the per-target allocations must sum to `getIssuancePerBlock()`.
// Every comparison here is done in wei as BigInt, never in floating point, so "equal" means equal.
