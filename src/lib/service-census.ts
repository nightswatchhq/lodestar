/**
 * How many providers has each data service actually got, read from chain rather than from us?
 *
 * G-1 in the delivery tracker is the top programme risk: every service in this stack has a provider
 * list that reads "us", and a data service with one provider is a contract address rather than a
 * market. The tracker recorded those counts by hand, and hand-written counts drift: it carried
 * Seahorn at 0 while the registry held two registrations, and left "what is the actual Dispatch
 * provider count?" open as a question when it is four RPC calls to settle.
 *
 * So this reads the registries. Every one of these contracts is a fork of the same Horizon
 * `DataService` base and emits the same two events, which is what makes one reader work across all
 * of them.
 *
 * The distinction that runs through the whole module, inherited from `dispatch-liveness.ts` and
 * worth repeating: **registered** is a promise and **serving** is evidence. Dispatch had two
 * registered providers and zero answering endpoints for 39 days, and nothing we monitored noticed,
 * because everything we monitored was on-chain and on-chain state stayed green throughout.
