# DIPS integration

Last checked: 2 September 2026.

Direct Indexer Payments are wired on Arbitrum One and allocated nothing. Every contract is
deployed, every configuration step has been taken, and the indexing-agreement allocation is zero.
The whole thing turns on one governance transaction that nobody can predict the hour of.

That shapes everything below. This is a surface whose subject **has not happened yet**, so every
table that will matter is empty, every query returns no rows, and an empty result is
indistinguishable from a broken one. Absent data rendering as healthy is the failure mode here, not
a slow page.

This document records what Lodestar reads today, what the nest already holds that nothing reads,
and how any of it can be validated before the day it matters.

## Ground truth, measured

Read from the IssuanceAllocator at `0xb64f29b2d81140ffc3a135e319561a1bd03b1a7e` over RPC on
2 September 2026:

```
getIssuancePerBlock : 120.73 GRT/block

target                                       total   allocMint   selfMint
0x28cd…dde1e  DefaultAllocation               0.000      0.000      0.000
0x971b…a525   RewardsManager                 96.584      0.000     96.584
0x2ff0…b16e   InnovationAllocation           24.146     24.146      0.000

sum of per-target total: 120.73 == getIssuancePerBlock
```

Three things follow, and each of them cost something to learn.

**A target's share is `allocatorMintingRate + selfMintingRate`.** The two fields are mechanism, not
amount: the allocator either mints the share and sends it, or the target mints its own. `Allocation`
exposes the sum as `totalAllocationRate`, but `TargetAllocationUpdated` carries only the two parts,
so anything reading the event has to add them back. Reading either field alone is wrong in both
directions: self-only zeroes InnovationAllocation, allocator-only zeroes the RewardsManager.

**The `Allocation` struct has three fields, not two.** `(totalAllocationRate, allocatorMintingRate,
selfMintingRate)`. A two-field ABI decodes without error and returns values shifted by one position,
which is a wrong answer that looks exactly like a right one. Decode against the ABI in
`nuthatch-org/dips-nest/abis/`, never against a reading of the docs.

**The sum is an exact invariant.** Per-target totals equal `getIssuancePerBlock()`. Not
approximately, exactly. That is the cheapest correctness check available on this surface and it is
what caught the bug described below.

## What Lodestar reads today

The configuration surface, and nothing else. `dips-nest` exposes 56 tables; two views are consumed.

| Surface | Source | State |
|---|---|---|
| `GET /api/dips` | `dips_current_allocation`, `dips_timeline` | Live behind `NUTHATCH_DIPS` |
| `DipsStatus` panel | the above | Live on the homepage |
| `check-dips` cron | same two views, read direct | Every 10 minutes |
| Public SQL dataset `dips` | `/dips/sql` | Live |
| Named queries | `dips_agreements` and one other | Live |
| Nest health | `/dips/ready` via `check-nest-health` | Every 15 minutes |

There is deliberately **no subgraph fallback**. Nothing else indexes these three contracts, which is
the entire reason the panel exists, and a fallback would only be a way of inventing numbers. The
cost of that decision is that the surface has no second opinion, which is what the validation
section is about.

### The bug this document was written after

Until 2 September the panel summed self-minted rates alone. Production therefore reported
InnovationAllocation at `0.00` and `0%` while it drew 24.146 GRT/block, a fifth of all issuance, and
put the total at 96.584 against a real 120.73.

The same defect sat in `check-dips`, where it mattered more. `dips_live` is the alert for the single
event this entire workstream waits on. Had governance funded DefaultAllocation through the
allocator-minted field, that alert would never have fired and the dashboard would have gone on
reading **Armed**.

Neither was visible from the dashboard, because both rendered as plausible numbers.

## What the nest holds and nothing reads

The full agreement lifecycle is already indexed. Every table below exists in `dips-nest` today and
every one of them is empty, which is the argument for building against them now rather than in a
hurry on the day they fill.

| Stage | Table | Carries |
|---|---|---|
| Offer | `recurring_collector__offer_stored` | `agreementId`, `payer`, `offerType`, `offerHash` |
| Offer withdrawn | `recurring_collector__offer_cancelled` | `caller`, `agreementId`, `hash` |
| Acceptance | `recurring_collector__agreement_accepted` | `dataService`, `payer`, `serviceProvider`, `endsAt`, `maxInitialTokens`, `maxOngoingTokensPerSecond`, `min`/`maxSecondsPerCollection` |
| Registration | `recurring_agreement_manager__agreement_added` | `agreementId`, `collector`, `dataService`, `provider` |
| Refusal | `recurring_agreement_manager__agreement_rejected` | `agreementId`, `collector`, `reason` (enum) |
| Amendment | `recurring_collector__agreement_updated` | revised terms |
| Reconciliation | `recurring_agreement_manager__agreement_reconciled` | `oldMaxNextClaim`, `newMaxNextClaim` |
| Collection | `recurring_collector__rca_collected` | `collectionId`, `tokens`, `dataServiceCut` |
| Payment | `recurring_collector__payment_collected` | `paymentType`, `payer`, `receiver`, `tokens` |
| Cancellation | `recurring_collector__agreement_canceled` | `canceledBy` |
| Removal | `recurring_agreement_manager__agreement_removed` | `agreementId` |
| Escrow | `recurring_agreement_manager__escrow_funded` / `__escrow_withdrawn` | `provider`, `collector`, `deposited` / `tokens` |
| Signer authority | `recurring_collector__signer_authorized` / `__signer_thawing` / `__signer_revoked` | `authorizer`, `signer` |

`agreement_rejected` deserves particular note: it carries a reason enum, which is the "why did my
agreement not take" signal an indexer will actually want, and it is the sort of thing that is
miserable to reconstruct after the fact.

A per-indexer portfolio keys off `serviceProvider` on the collector tables and `provider` on the
manager tables. No additional indexing is required for it.

## Two corrections to the roadmap's plan

**POI presentation does not belong in this lifecycle.** The roadmap's lifecycle bullet reads
"offer → acceptance → POI presentation → collection → cancellation". POIs are presented to the data
service, not to the RecurringCollector, and no event in any of these three contracts carries one.
`dips-nest` cannot answer that leg at all. It needs either a second nest over the SubgraphService or
the bullet redrawn to stop at what these contracts actually see.

**Configured is not the same as distributed.** The panel currently reports the configured rate.
`IssuanceDistributed` and `IssuanceSelfMintAllowance` are the events that say GRT actually moved. A
rate set but never distributed would read as **Live** with nothing flowing, which is a subtler
version of exactly the failure the panel exists to prevent.

## The Dipper

Not integrated, and it should stay that way. The Dipper is the Foundation's gateway-internal
component under GIP-0081's off-chain MVP. DIPS settles through `RecurringCollector` under GIP-0087,
which is a different path, and `nuthatch-org/weaver` already covers it: it builds, signs and checks
Recurring Collection Agreements with the EIP-712 hashing verified against the deployed contract
rather than against a reading of the spec.

The roadmap's old "Dipper client in the gateway" task is struck through for this reason. Every
remaining mention of the Dipper in this repo is prose.

There is a Vercel project named `dipper` on the account. It serves a 404 and holds nothing.

## Validating a surface whose subject has not happened

Four things, roughly in order of how much they buy.

### 1. A Sepolia nest

Still the highest-value move, and now measured rather than assumed. Read from Arbitrum Sepolia over
RPC on 2 September 2026:

```
RecurringCollector 0x0b18befc60455121ad66ae6e4a647955fcde3900
  OfferStored             113 logs
  AgreementAccepted       111 logs
  RCACollected           1099 logs
  AgreementCanceled         4 logs

RecurringAgreementManager 0x590dbbbdb1b6261e39bcc1fe88bffc21c847a68e
  AgreementAdded          113 logs
  AgreementRejected         0 logs
```

**The entire lifecycle has already been exercised on Sepolia.** Not a fixture, not a fork test:
1,440 real events including 1,099 collections. That changes the argument for a Sepolia nest from
"it would be nice to have data" to "the data is sitting there".

The folding in `src/lib/dips-agreements.ts` has been validated against exactly that. Reading the
logs directly and shaping them into the row form the nest produces:

```
events folded       : 1440
agreements          : 113   (109 active, 4 cancelled)
total collected GRT : 892.3282
raw sum of RCACollected tokens: 892.3282 GRT   <- independent, agrees exactly
cancelled on chain  : 4      folded as cancelled: 4
```

So the lifecycle view is not written blind. What a Sepolia **nest** would add on top is the
`/sql` path itself: the exact table and column names, the `_dec` companions, and the provenance
envelope, none of which an RPC log read exercises.

Deploying it needs the Helsinki box, which is the only part of this document nobody can do from a
laptop. The config is otherwise a copy of the mainnet nest with three addresses changed:

```toml
[nest]
name = "dips-nest-sepolia"
chain = "arbitrum-sepolia"
chain_id = 421614
block_timestamps = true

[[contracts]]
alias = "issuance_allocator"
address = "0x76a0d75651d4db83f74ac502b86a0ae4e19ac38b"

[[contracts]]
alias = "recurring_agreement_manager"
address = "0x590dbbbdb1b6261e39bcc1fe88bffc21c847a68e"

[[contracts]]
alias = "recurring_collector"
address = "0x0b18befc60455121ad66ae6e4a647955fcde3900"
```

Addresses from `packages/issuance/addresses.json` and `packages/horizon/addresses.json` in
graphprotocol/contracts, chain 421614. The ABIs and views carry over from the mainnet nest
unchanged.

### 2. Cross-check the nest against the chain

Done, in #33. `/api/cron/check-dips-chain` runs hourly. The allocator answers `getTargets()`, `getTargetAllocation(address)`,
`getTotalAllocation()` and `getIssuancePerBlock()` directly, which is an independent oracle for an
otherwise unopposed surface.

`/ready` catches a nest that has stopped. Nothing catches a nest that is running happily and merely
missed a log, and that failure renders as a plausible number. The invariant above is exact, so the
check is cheap and unambiguous: if the per-target shares stop summing to `getIssuancePerBlock()`, a
log went missing.

Running this by hand once found both the totalling bug and the fact that InnovationAllocation had
arrived on mainnet at all.

### 3. Fixtures for the path that has never executed

Done for `/api/dips` and `check-dips` as of 2 September. This is the only way to test the switch
being flipped, since it cannot be observed. The cases worth holding: the flip arriving on either
minting field, an absent allocation staying distinguishable from a measured zero, an unlabelled new
target still appearing rather than being dropped, and an unready nest producing an error rather than
a confident zero.

### 4. Address-book drift

The labels in `/api/dips` were reconciled against `packages/issuance/addresses.json` in
`graphprotocol/contracts`, chain 42161. That file is the thing to diff against. InnovationAllocation
sat in it, funded, while the roadmap still carried it as "on Sepolia only today", and nothing
noticed because an unlabelled address at a plausible rate looks like noise.

## Work

- [x] Cross-check cron against the allocator over RPC (#31). Landed in #33 as
      `/api/cron/check-dips-chain`, hourly. Reads `getTargets`, `getTargetAllocation` and
      `getIssuancePerBlock`, compares against `dips_current_allocation` in exact wei, and
      edge-triggers on a signature of the divergence set so a standing one does not become
      wallpaper. A missing target counts as a divergence even at zero, because a zero the nest has
      never recorded is a missed log rather than an empty allocation.
- [x] **Agreement lifecycle view.** `GET /api/dips/agreements`, folding nine event tables into
      agreements and one ordered event stream, with `DipsAgreements` on the homepage. The panel
      renders nothing while the lifecycle is empty, because an empty table with headings would
      imply agreements happen here and simply are not happening, which is a different and wronger
      claim than saying nothing. Validated against 1,440 real Sepolia events, above.
- [x] **Per-indexer agreement portfolio.** `?indexer=0x…` on the same route. It is a narrowing of
      the same data, so it does not warrant a second read of nine tables.
- [x] **Configured versus distributed issuance.** `/api/dips` now reads the latest
      `IssuanceDistributed` and `IssuanceSelfMintAllowance` per target and reports
      `configuredNotDistributed`: a rate governance set that the chain has never acted on. Empty is
      the healthy answer.
- [x] **Alert on a new allocation _target_, not only a new rate.** `target_allocation_set` does
      fire for a newly registered target, and that path now has an explicit test. It had never been
      exercised, which is how "it would have been caught" stayed a theory while
      InnovationAllocation went unremarked.
- [ ] **Deploy `dips-nest-sepolia` to Helsinki.** The one item that needs the box. Config authored
      in [nuthatch-org/dips-nest#1](https://github.com/nuthatch-org/dips-nest/pull/1), with
      `start_block` values read over RPC rather than taken from a deployment record. It buys the
      `/sql` path itself: exact table and column names, the `_dec` companions and the provenance
      envelope, none of which an RPC log read exercises.

### POI presentation: decided, and the answer is no

The roadmap carried "offer → acceptance → **POI presentation** → collection → cancellation" as one
bullet. That middle leg does not belong in it, and the reason is structural rather than a matter of
effort: POIs are presented to the data service, and no event on the RecurringCollector or the
RecurringAgreementManager carries one. `dips-nest` indexes those two contracts and the
IssuanceAllocator, so it cannot answer that leg at any level of cleverness.

The lifecycle view therefore stops where these contracts stop, and says so. Answering the POI leg
means a second nest over the SubgraphService, which is a different piece of work with a different
contract set, and folding it into this bullet only made this bullet permanently unfinishable.
