Analytics dashboard for The Graph Protocol on Arbitrum One. Real-time network metrics, indexer intelligence, delegation tools, portfolio tracking, curation management, and subgraph developer tooling.

**Live:** [lodestar-dashboard.com](https://lodestar-dashboard.com)

## Features

- **Protocol Overview** — Total stake, delegation, signalling, total supply, estimated annual issuance, epoch progress, a per-epoch fees/rewards table with derived status (Active/Settling/Distributing/Finalized), rewards-per-epoch chart, token distribution. Delegation Flows chart shows inflow/outflow bar chart with current-vs-previous period comparison and net GRT summary.
- **Intel Feed** — Live protocol intelligence panel with governance proposals, GIP updates, epoch summaries, and announcements sourced from The Graph Forum, GitHub, and on-chain data
- **Indexer Directory** — Sortable/filterable table with stake, delegation capacity, reward cuts, delegation-parameter cooldown remaining, REO eligibility indicators, recent delegation activity icons, and mobile card view
- **Indexer Profiles** — Detailed view with active and historical/closed allocations, operator addresses, disputes & slashing history, delegator breakdown, Horizon service provisions, REO eligibility assessment, recent delegation activity, and reward cut change alerts
- **Accurate APR & Effective Cut** — Per-allocation signal-weighted APR calculation and effective cut formula matching [grtinfo](https://github.com/ellipfra/grtinfo)

## Roadmap

### Planned

- [ ] PWA support — installable to home screen for daily portfolio checking
- [ ] Amp node reconnection — re-enable Horizon Activity live feed with persistent Amp connection

### Shipped

- [x] **v4.0.0 — Hardening campaign complete.** Logic-tier test coverage lifted 33% → **86%** (1,500+ tests across lib/API/hooks) with a ratcheting CI gate; full security audit (`SECURITY_AUDIT_V4.md`) with every actionable finding fixed — SSRF defence (shared guard + DNS-rebinding check), real per-instance rate limiting, gateway error redaction, an unhandled-rejection fix in the cache layer; plus the v3.4.0 infra/security work below.
- [x] Security & infra hardening (v3.4.0) — forced-TLS Postgres (`sslmode=require`) and TLS-only Redis (`rediss://`, plaintext port firewalled); fixed all high-severity `axios` CVEs; fail-closed timing-safe cron auth; GraphQL-injection + SSRF guards on the indexer-agent proxy; gateway deployment-id validation; timing-safe session HMAC; signature-gated push unsubscribe; offsite pull-model Postgres backups.

## Indexer Scoring

Each indexer receives a composite score (0–100) across eleven dimensions, combined with transparent weights. The score is designed for delegator decision-making — higher is better.

### Dimensions & Weights

| Dimension | Weight | What it measures |
|---|---|---|
| **REO Compliance** | 20% | Rewards Eligibility Oracle status (GIP-0079). Eligible with runway = 100, ineligible = 0. Oracle-sourced data gets full marks; heuristic fallback = partial credit. |
| **Allocation Efficiency** | 13% | Allocated tokens ÷ provisioned tokens. Higher utilisation = more operationally competent. 80%+ = 100, no allocations = 0. |
| **Self-Stake** | 12% | Absolute GRT staked by the indexer — skin in the game. Scored on raw amount, **not** as a ratio of total stake. Having more delegation does *not* reduce this score. Anchors: 100K (protocol minimum) = 35, 500K = 65, 1M = 80, 10M+ = 100, with linear interpolation between points. |
| **Delegator Cut** | 10% | How much of the earnings delegators actually keep. Uses **effective cut** (what delegators actually experience, accounting for indexer's own stake ratio) when available, falling back to raw cut. 0% cut = 100, 25% = 60, 50% = 35, 100% = 0. 100% query fee cut applies a further -15 penalty. |
| **Delegation Safety** | 9% | How close the indexer is to maximum delegation capacity (self-stake × 16). Lower utilisation = more room for new delegators without reward dilution. <50% used = 100, 100% full = 0. |
| **Transparency** | 8% | Has the indexer set an ENS name (+40), website URL (+30), and display name (+30)? Presence and accountability signals. |
| **Delegator APY** | 8% | Actual returns delivered to delegators. Uses 30-day rolling realised APY from closed allocations when available, falling back to estimated APR from current allocations. Anchors: 20%+ = 100, 10% = 75, 5% = 50, 1% = 20, 0% = 0. New indexers with strong returns benefit directly. |
| **Data Service Coverage** | 5% | Distinct Horizon data services provisioned to. Supporting multiple services (Subgraph Service, Dispatch JSON-RPC, etc.) signals broader protocol commitment. 1 service = 40, 2 = 75, 3+ = 100. |
| **Query Volume** | 6% | Cumulative query fees collected in GRT — proof the indexer serves real query traffic. Anchors: 100K+ GRT = 100, 50K = 90, 10K = 70, 1K = 50, >0 = 15, 0 = 0. |
| **Cut Stability** | 6% | How long since the indexer last changed reward/query fee parameters. Longer = more predictable. 180+ days = 100, <7 days = 30. Bonus +10 if a cooldown period is set. Hard cap for greedy cuts (100% reward cut → forced to 5). |
| **Delegation Trend** | 3% | 7-day net delegation flow as a percentage of total delegated stake. Positive inflow = crowd confidence; outflow = warning. Low weight because it's inherently noisy. No delegation = neutral 50. |

### Grades

| Score | Grade |
|---|---|
| 80–100 | A |
| 65–79 | B |
| 50–64 | C |
| 35–49 | D |
| 0–34 | F |

### Design Principles

- **No black boxes** — every dimension, weight, and threshold is visible in [`src/lib/risk-score.ts`](src/lib/risk-score.ts)
- **Zero extra API calls** — scores are computed from data the enrichment pipeline already fetches
- **Delegation-neutral self-stake** — attracting delegation is a sign of trust, not something to penalise
- **Delegator-first, but a deduction rather than a disqualification** — a 100% reward cut zeroes Delegator Cut (10%) and Delegator APY (8%), and caps Cut Stability (6%) at 5. That costs a flawless indexer 24 points, taking it from 100 (A) to **76 (B)**. It is a visible markdown, not a failing grade. If you want cuts excluded outright rather than marked down, that is the ≥ 90% hard filter in [One-Click Delegation](#one-click-delegation), which the score deliberately does not duplicate
- **Feedback welcome** — if the weights or thresholds feel off, [open an issue](https://github.com/nightswatchhq/lodestar/issues)

## One-Click Delegation

`/delegate` is the simplest path to delegating GRT. Connect a wallet, enter an amount, confirm — we handle indexer selection. No research required.

### How it works

**1. Hard filters** — applied at request time, not cached:

- REO ineligible → excluded
- Delegation capacity ≥ 90% → excluded
- Reward cut ≥ 90% → excluded

**2. Preference-weighted scoring** — the existing per-indexer `scoreBreakdown` (computed nightly by the cron) is re-weighted based on four optional sliders:

| Preference | Boosts |
|---|---|
| Best returns | `delegatorAPY`, `delegatorCut` |
| Stability | `cutStability` |
| Safety | `overDelegation`, `selfStake` |
| Network contribution | `queryVolume`, `allocationEfficiency`, `reo` |

Each slider runs 0–10, default 5 (neutral = standard weights). At 10 the relevant dimension weights are doubled; at 0 they are zeroed. Weights are re-normalized to 100 after adjustment.

**3. Rank and pick** — dot product of adjusted weights × dimension scores across all eligible indexers. The top result is selected. The three highest-contributing dimensions become the "why we picked this" reasons shown in the card.

With default preferences this is effectively "highest overall risk score among REO-eligible, non-full indexers." Adjusting preferences shifts emphasis without changing the underlying scoring model.

### UX flow

1. Page loads → recommendation fetched automatically with default weights
2. Recommended indexer shown: name, grade, three reasons
3. Enter amount → approve (first time only) → delegate
4. Optional: expand "Customise selection" → adjust sliders → recommendation updates live

The approval step is skipped on subsequent delegations if the existing GRT allowance covers the amount. First-time delegators need two transactions; all others need one.

## Backend migration

The API is moving from Next.js route handlers to **kittiwake**, a single Rust process that fronts
the nuthatch nests. The two run side by side on one domain: the edge forwards the routes kittiwake
serves and leaves the rest here, so there is no flag day.

The count is deliberately not repeated here, because a number typed into a README is a number that
goes stale. It lives in one generated place: [docs/MIGRATION.md](docs/MIGRATION.md), produced from
`src/lib/migration.ts`. The same figures render at
[`/migration`](https://www.lodestar-dashboard.com/migration) with `/api/migration` as the
machine-readable form.

That one file is also what `src/proxy.ts` routes from, so the progress figure and the routing
decision cannot disagree. A test walks `src/app/api` and fails if a route exists without a line in
the table, which is what stops a new route becoming an uncounted straggler. Regenerate the doc with
`pnpm migration:doc` after changing the inventory; CI fails if the committed copy is stale.

## Tech Stack

- Next.js 16.2.6 (App Router, Turbopack)
- React 19.2.6, TypeScript 5, Tailwind CSS 4
- wagmi v3 + viem (Arbitrum One)
- @tanstack/react-query + @tanstack/react-table
- Recharts (area charts, donut charts)
- Self-hosted Postgres 16 (postgres.js, forced TLS) + self-hosted Redis (TLS / `rediss://`), with an in-memory cache fallback
- CoinGecko + DefiLlama (price/TVL data)
- [**nuthatch**](https://www.nuthatch-indexer.com) — our own self-hosted indexer, serving every piece of Graph Protocol data on the dashboard. No Graph API key, no gateway client, no fallback (see [Data from nuthatch](#data-from-nuthatch))
- Arbitrum One RPC for on-chain contract reads (`ARBITRUM_RPC_URL`, with public endpoints as fallback)
- Amp (`ampd`) — optional self-hosted on-chain event indexer, retained for `/api/horizon/*`
- Push Protocol — opt-in delegator notifications via on-chain channel

## Data from nuthatch

Every piece of Graph Protocol data on this dashboard comes from [**nuthatch**](https://www.nuthatch-indexer.com),
a self-hosted, single-binary indexer we run ourselves. It indexes the protocol contracts on Arbitrum One
directly and exposes them over SQL. There is no Graph API key in Lodestar, no gateway client and no
fallback path: an unavailable nest is reported as an error rather than silently changing the source.

Lodestar reads five nests. They sit behind one host and one basic-auth credential, selected by base path:

| Base path | Nest | What it holds | What it serves |
|---|---|---|---|
| `/alloc` | `graph-allocations-nest` | The whole protocol: staking, delegation, curation, allocations, epochs, disputes, RAVs, GRT supply | Network stats, indexers, curators, epochs, payments, portfolio, provisions, POI, rewards history, feed, token metrics, the subgraph routes, both OpenGraph images and every ingest cron |
| `/gns` | `graph-gns-nest` | L2GNS publish and metadata events | Subgraph names and versions, the Developer Activity chart |
| `/dips` | DIPS (Arbitrum One) | Indexing-agreement lifecycle | `/api/dips/agreements` |
| `/dips-sepolia` | DIPS (Arbitrum Sepolia) | The same lifecycle on testnet, where there are rows | `/api/dips/agreements` when `NUTHATCH_DIPS_BASE_PATH` selects it |
| `/legacy-flows` | `graph-staking-legacy-readonly` | Pre-Horizon and Horizon delegation together, which neither staking contract gives you alone | Delegation Flows |

`/legacy-flows` is archival by design. It answers from sealed segments and does not advance, so its head
never moves and nest-health alerting excludes it deliberately: a frozen archive reports `stalled` for
ever and is correct to.

All five are also exposed publicly and read-only at [`/sql`](https://www.lodestar-dashboard.com/sql),
where every answer carries its own provenance block.

### One nest carries almost everything

The horizon and staking nests were folded into `graph-allocations-nest`, so `/alloc` now fronts what used
to be three. Of the 34 files in `src/` that name a base path, 33 name `/alloc`. Two name `/gns` and one
names `/dips`, and both of the `/gns` readers also read `/alloc`.

That concentration matters operationally. A nest's `/sql` surface admits **two** concurrent queries and
refuses the rest with `503 server busy: too many concurrent SQL queries`, which is the node protecting
itself. `src/lib/nuthatch.ts` holds a one-slot gate and a short retry ladder so our own composition is
never the cause of a refusal, but that gate bounds one Node process and serverless runs many. When
`/alloc` saturates, every panel it feeds reports unavailable at the same moment while the other four
nests carry on answering perfectly well.

Connection configuration is `NUTHATCH_URL`, `NUTHATCH_USER` and `NUTHATCH_PASSWORD`, with optional
`NUTHATCH_*_BASE_PATH` overrides to point an individual surface at a different nest. The checked-in
[migration checklist](docs/nuthatch-migration.md) records the cutovers and the parity work behind them.

## Getting Started

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Required |
|---|---|---|
| `DATABASE_URL` | Postgres connection string (`postgresql://user:pass@host:port/db?sslmode=require`) | Yes |
| `REDIS_URL` | Redis connection string (`rediss://` for TLS — self-hosted or managed). Falls back to a process-local in-memory cache when unset | No |
| `CRON_SECRET` | Random string to protect cron endpoints (auth fails closed if unset) | Yes |
| `ARBITRUM_RPC_URL` | Arbitrum One RPC URL (Alchemy, Infura, etc.) | Yes |
| `NUTHATCH_URL` | Base URL of the nuthatch host fronting every nest. Without it, every protocol route returns 503 | Yes |
| `NUTHATCH_USER` / `NUTHATCH_PASSWORD` | Basic-auth credential for that host | Yes |
| `NUTHATCH_*_BASE_PATH` | Per-surface overrides to point one route at a different nest. Defaults are `/alloc`, except `/gns` and `/dips` (see [Data from nuthatch](#data-from-nuthatch)) | No |
| `GITHUB_TOKEN` | GitHub PAT for the Intel Feed (forum/GIP data) | Yes |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` | Production URL e.g. `https://lodestar-dashboard.com` | Yes |
| `SESSION_SECRET` | Secret for Studio session HMAC | No |
| `TAP_SIGNER_PRIVATE_KEY` | Private key for TAP receipt signing | No |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_BOUNTY_BOARD_ADDRESS` | Deployed BountyBoard contract address | No |
| `AMP_ENDPOINT` | Self-hosted `ampd` endpoint for Horizon event history | No |
| `AMP_TOKEN` | Auth token for the `ampd` nginx proxy | No |
| `PUSH_CHANNEL_ADDRESS` | Push Protocol channel wallet address | No |
| `PUSH_CHANNEL_PRIVATE_KEY` | Push Protocol channel private key | No |
| `PUSH_ENV` | Push Protocol environment — `staging` or `prod` | No |
| `DISPATCH_GATEWAY_URL` | PostgREST endpoint for Seahorn swap data | No |
| `INDEXER_AGENT_URL` | Indexer agent management API URL | No |
| `INDEXER_AGENT_TOKEN` | Basic auth credentials for indexer agent (`user:pass`) | No |
| `SCUTTLEBUTT_ADMIN_SECRET` | Admin login password for Scuttlebutt (moderation). Auth fails closed if unset | No |
| `SCUTTLEBUTT_TRIP_SALT` | HMAC salt for tripcodes — without it trips are guessable | No |
| `SCUTTLEBUTT_IP_PEPPER` | HMAC pepper for hashing poster IPs (raw IPs are never stored) | No |
| `SCUTTLEBUTT_EXTRA_BLOCKWORDS` | Comma-separated extra words for the profanity mask | No |

Horizon event history (`/api/horizon/*`), Push notifications, and Seahorn all degrade gracefully when their env vars are absent.

Scuttlebutt (`/scuttlebutt`) is the anonymous chat: persistent history in Postgres, live delivery via Redis pub/sub → SSE, old-school `Name#secret` tripcodes, a flood/profanity guard, and admin (cookie signed with `SESSION_SECRET`) moderation — soft-delete and ban by IP-hash or tripcode. With no `DATABASE_URL` the page reports unavailable; with no `REDIS_URL` it falls back to history reads only (no live push).

## Database Backups

The lodestar Postgres database (on the primary VPS) is backed up nightly to a separate offsite VPS using a **pull model**: the backup box reaches into the primary and pulls a compressed `pg_dump`, rather than the primary pushing out. If the primary is ever compromised, the attacker has no path to the backups.

```
PRIMARY (DB host)                          BACKUP (offsite)
  Postgres :5433        nightly 03:17 UTC    pull-lodestar-backup.sh (cron)
  lodestar-dump-stdout.sh  ◀──── SSH ────────  pulls + verifies + retains
        │                  forced-command key        ↓
        └── pg_dump -Fc ──────────────────▶  daily/ (7) · weekly/ (4) · monthly/ (6)
```

- **`scripts/lodestar-dump-stdout.sh`** — runs on the primary. Emits a compressed `pg_dump -Fc` of `lodestar` to stdout via local peer auth (no DB password on disk). This is the *only* thing the backup key is permitted to run — it's wired as a forced command in the primary's `authorized_keys`, locked down with `no-pty,no-port-forwarding,...`, so a stolen key can do nothing but request a dump.
- **`scripts/pull-lodestar-backup.sh`** — runs on the backup box via cron (daily 03:17 UTC). Pulls the dump, **verifies it before keeping it** (size, `PGDMP` magic, table count), files it into `daily/`, then hardlink-promotes to `weekly/` (Sundays) and `monthly/` (1st of month). Retention: **7 daily / 4 weekly / 6 monthly**.

Dumps are custom-format (`-Fc`). Restore with:

```bash
pg_restore -h <host> -p <port> -U postgres -d <db> --no-owner --no-acl lodestar-<ts>.dump
psql -h <host> -p <port> -U postgres -d <db> -f scripts/fix-ownership.sql
```

**The second line is not optional.** `--no-owner` gives every restored object to the user doing the
restore, which above is `postgres`, while the application connects as `lodestar`. Skip it and the
database comes back complete and entirely unreadable by the app: every statement fails with `42501`,
and a fire-and-forget writer will not tell you (this is #113, which cost one table months of silently
discarded clicks). `scripts/fix-ownership.sql` is idempotent and prints what it had to change.

Restores are periodically test-verified against a throwaway Postgres container. These are nightly logical dumps (no point-in-time recovery) — appropriate for an analytics DB that re-ingests from chain.
